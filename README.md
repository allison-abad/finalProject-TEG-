## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5 and css3

For this project I used markup languages HTML5 and CSS3. HTML holds the content of my application and also stores the links to enhance the CSS3 to proivde a more attractive look for potential users.


## Lessons Learned:

When using certain resources to enhance CSS, I've learned it's important to properly link files within the DOM to allow proper design/content exposure onto the client server side.
